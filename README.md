Introduction
In the context of the ongoing global health crisis, ensuring the widespread use of face masks is crucial in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. This Face Mask Detection Object uses computer vision techniques to analyze images or video streams and determine whether individuals in the frame are wearing face masks or not.

Features
Real-time face mask detection in images or video streams.
Easy integration with existing security systems or surveillance cameras.
Customizable for different mask types and settings.
Installation
To set up the Face Mask Detection Object on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Chirag-244/facemask_detection_using_OpenCV
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd facemask-detection-object
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
Usage
To use the Face Mask Detection Object, you can follow these general steps:

Run the detection script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Provide input, either by specifying an image path or using your computer's webcam.

View the output, which will display the input image or video stream with face masks identified.

Model Training
If you want to train the model with your own dataset, refer to the Model Training documentation for detailed instructions.

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of images containing people with and without masks. You can find the dataset and its details in the Dataset documentation.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow
NumPy
